title: GRC's DNS Benchmark
summary: A utility to determine the exact performance of DNS nameservers
description: |
  GRC's DNS Benchmark performs a detailed analysis and comparison of the
  operational performance and reliability of any set of up to 200 DNS
  nameservers (sometimes also called resolvers) at once. When the
  Benchmark is started in its default configuration, it identifies all
  DNS nameservers the user's system is currently configured to use and
  adds them to its built-in list of publicly available “alternative”
  nameservers. Each DNS nameserver in the benchmark list is carefully
  “characterized” to determine its suitability — to you — for your use
  as a DNS resolver. This characterization includes testing each
  nameserver for its “redirection” behavior: whether it returns an error
  for a bad domain request, or redirects a user's web browser to a
  commercial marketing-oriented page. While such behavior may be
  acceptable to some users, others may find this objectionable.

  NOTE: This is NOT an official distribution of GRC's DNS Benchmark,
  please refer to the snap's own issue tracker for support:
